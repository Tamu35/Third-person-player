Third person camera and control project I made with C# language on unity by following the Game Dev Experiments channel on Youtube.
The goal here is to repeat by doing the same thing the developer did.
In this project, besides simple third-person camera control, it includes simple walking (WASD) and 3 animations (idle, walk, run).
